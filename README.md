Mage2 Module Experius ExceptionDebugger
====================

**IMPORTANT:** *Use this module only for development purposes*

This module logs the actual error, if the shown error is like `An error occurred on the server.`

This module makes it easier to debug the Payment step in the checkout. Because with this feature you don't have to manually added files and then reproduce the error because it is already logged.
